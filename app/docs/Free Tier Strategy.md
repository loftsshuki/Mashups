# Mashups Free Tier & Growth Strategy

**Objective:** Maximize user acquisition through free offerings while creating clear upgrade paths to paid tiers.

---

## 🎁 Free Tier Options

### Option 1: "Starter" Free Tier (Recommended)
**Tagline:** "Create free forever. Upgrade when you're ready to go pro."

**What's Free:**
| Feature | Limit | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Mashup Creation | 3/month | Reset monthly |
| Basic Stem Library | 100 stems | Rotating selection |
| Standard Export | MP3 only | 128kbps quality |
| Basic Analytics | Last 7 days | Plays only |
| Community Features | Full access | Social features unlimited |
| Storage | 500MB | ~20 mashups |
| Support | Community | Discord/forum only |

**Limits That Drive Upgrade:**
- Watermark on exports: "Made with Mashups.com"
- No commercial licensing
- No AI tools (stem separation, mastering)
- No collaboration features
- No advanced analytics
- Cannot download individual stems
- Max 2-minute track length

**Upgrade Triggers:**
- Hit 3 mashup limit → "You've been busy! Unlock unlimited"
- Try AI feature → "Upgrade to unlock AI magic"
- Export with watermark → "Remove watermark with Pro"
- 7 days of analytics → "See your full history with Pro"

---

### Option 2: "Freemium + Time Unlock"
**Tagline:** "Start free. Everything unlocks with time OR upgrade instantly."

**Mechanic:**
- All Pro features available from day 1
- But locked behind "time gates" or "achievement gates"
- Can bypass by upgrading

**Time Gates Example:**
| Feature | Free Wait Time | Or Upgrade Now |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| AI Stem Separation | 7 days | Pro instant |
| Mastering | 14 days | Pro instant |
| Collaboration | 3 days + 1 mashup | Pro instant |
| Commercial License | 30 days + 5 mashups | Pro instant |
| HD Export | 5 days | Pro instant |

**Psychology:** Users see what they're missing, can earn it through patience/engagement, or buy instant gratification.

---

### Option 3: "Ad-Supported Free"
**Tagline:** "Free with ads. Remove them anytime."

**What's Free:**
- Unlimited mashups
- Full feature access
- All export formats

**The Catch:**
- Audio ads play between workflow steps (every ~5 minutes)
- Banner ads in UI
- Pre-roll video ads before exporting
- Sponsor messages in community feeds
- "Watch ad to unlock premium stem" option

**Upgrade Path:**
- $4.99/month to remove all ads
- Users can tolerate ads or pay to remove

**Revenue Model:**
- Ad revenue from free users
- Subscription from ad-free users
- Hybrid: Some users stay free forever (ad revenue), some upgrade

---

### Option 4: "Educational/Student Free"
**Tagline:** "Free for students. Learn music production."

**Who Qualifies:**
- .edu email verification
- Age 13-22
- Currently enrolled students

**What's Free:**
- Full Pro features
- Unlimited everything
- No watermarks
- BUT academic use only (no commercial)

**Monetization:**
- Students graduate → automatic conversion to paid
- "Student discount" $4.99/month (vs $9.99 regular)
- Builds habit during learning years
- Word-of-mouth in schools

**Partnerships:**
- Partner with music schools
- Campus ambassador program
- Curriculum integration
- "Classroom projects" using Mashups

---

### Option 5: "Open Source / Self-Hosted"
**Tagline:** "Host it yourself for free, or use our cloud."

**Model:**
- Core DAW engine is open source (GitHub)
- Free to download, self-host, modify
- BUT cloud features cost:
  - Storage
  - Collaboration
  - AI processing
  - Distribution

**Who It's For:**
- Developers
- Privacy-conscious users
- Enterprise self-hosting
- Tinkerers

**Revenue:**
- Managed cloud hosting (SaaS)
- Enterprise support contracts
- Premium AI API access
- White-label licensing

---

### Option 6: "Pay What You Want"
**Tagline:** "Name your price. Even $0."

**Mechanic:**
- User chooses price: $0, $1, $5, $10/month
- All tiers get same features
- BUT:
  - $0: Public profile, watermarked exports
  - $1+: Private profile option
  - $5+: Priority support
  - $10+: Early access to features

**Psychology:**
- Removes price barrier completely
- Guilt/obligation to pay something
- Most choose middle option ($5)
- Some generous users overpay

---

### Option 7: "Free Trial That Never Expires"
**Tagline:** "Try everything free. Forever."

**The Twist:**
- Full Pro access indefinitely
- BUT every export has:
  - 15-second "Powered by Mashups" audio watermark
  - Visual overlay ad
  - Forced social share to download

**Upgrade Path:**
- Remove watermark: $9.99/month
- "You're creating professional work. Time to go pro."

---

  - Brand logo on free exports
