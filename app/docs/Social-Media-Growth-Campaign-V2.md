# Mashups Social Media Growth Campaign — V2

**Campaign Name:** "The Flip Side"
**Duration:** 90 Days (Q2 2026)
**Objective:** 10,000 new creators, 50,000 MAU, K-factor > 0.4
**Budget:** $50,000

---

## How This Differs From V1

V1 is a standard social media marketing plan — content calendars, influencer tiers, paid ads, hashtag challenges. It would work for any SaaS product. V2 is built specifically for a music mashup platform, with three principles:

1. **Product IS the content.** The best marketing for a music creation tool is music created with the tool. Don't make ads — make mashups.
2. **Creators ARE the channel.** Every creator who ships a mashup is a distribution endpoint. Invest in making them successful, not in buying impressions.
3. **Earned > Paid.** $50K in paid ads buys ~5M impressions that vanish when you stop paying. $50K invested in creator success can build a self-sustaining growth engine.

## Target Audiences (Revised)

### Primary: The Frustrated Creator (18-28)
Has 100 ideas and 0 finished tracks. Uses GarageBand or free FL Studio, gets stuck in the "messy middle," abandons projects. Active on TikTok as a consumer, dreams of being a creator.

**What they need to hear:** "Finish your first track today. Not next week. Today."

**Where they are:** TikTok (consuming music content), YouTube (watching tutorials they never finish), Reddit (r/WeAreTheMusicMakers, r/makinghiphop asking "how do I start?")

### Secondary: The Content Creator Who Needs Sounds (16-26)
Makes TikToks, Reels, YouTube Shorts. Currently uses trending sounds or gets copyright strikes. Wants original audio that fits their content but can't produce music.

**What they need to hear:** "Make your own sounds. Never get a copyright claim again."

**Where they are:** TikTok (posting daily), Instagram (Reels), YouTube Shorts

### Tertiary: The Established Producer (22-35)
Already uses Ableton/FL Studio. Makes beats. Doesn't need another DAW — but might want a fast, social, collaborative remixing tool for fun, experimentation, and audience building.

**What they need to hear:** "Your Ableton projects are serious. This is for the weird stuff you make at 2 AM for fun."

**Where they are:** YouTube (watching production breakdowns), Twitter/X (producer Twitter), Discord (production servers), Reddit

## The Content Engine

### Core Principle: Every Piece of Content Must Contain Music Made on Mashups

No generic motivational posts. No stock imagery. No "5 tips for music producers" carousels. Every single post must feature audio created on the platform. The content IS the product demo.

### Content Type 1: The 15-Second Flip (40% of posts)

**Format:** Split-screen. Left side: recognizable song playing. Right side: the Mashups.com DAW transforming it in real time. Final result plays over both screens.

**Why it works:** The transformation is inherently satisfying (like pressure washing videos). The recognizable source song hooks attention. The speed demonstrates the platform's power. The result is the ad.

**Production:** Record screen captures of actual creators using the platform. No scripted demos — real creative sessions, sped up. Raw and authentic beats polished and fake.

**Volume:** 10-12 per week across platforms

### Content Type 2: The Impossible Mashup (20% of posts)

**Format:** "What if [Artist A] made [Genre B] music?" Then show it being created and play the result. "What if Beethoven made trap?" "What if Billie Eilish went drum & bass?"

**Why it works:** Curiosity gap drives clicks. The genre collision is inherently shareable and debatable (comments explode with opinions). It showcases the platform's AI stem-swapping and genre translation capabilities.

**Volume:** 3-4 per week

### Content Type 3: The Callout (15% of posts)

**Format:** Find a viral TikTok with mediocre audio. Publicly (and respectfully) remix it with better, original audio made on Mashups. Tag the original creator. "Hey @creator, love the video. Made you a custom soundtrack."

**Why it works:** Provides genuine value to the original creator (free custom audio). If they use it and credit Mashups, their audience discovers the platform. Even if they don't respond, the format is entertaining for viewers. It demonstrates the platform's speed and quality.

**Volume:** 2-3 per week

### Content Type 4: Creator Process Docs (15% of posts)

**Format:** 60-second documentary of a real creator's session. Not a tutorial — a story. "Sarah heard a street musician in Brooklyn. She recorded 10 seconds on her phone. Here's what she turned it into on Mashups." Show the journey from inspiration to finished track.

**Why it works:** Storytelling > tutorials. The narrative format is more engaging than "step 1, step 2." It humanizes the platform and positions Mashups as where real creative moments happen.

**Volume:** 2-3 per week

### Content Type 5: The Deconstruction (10% of posts)

**Format:** Take a mashup that's getting traction on the platform. Peel it apart layer by layer — mute each stem one at a time until you're down to the raw elements. Then rebuild. It's X-ray vision for music.

**Why it works:** Educational and satisfying. Viewers learn how mashups work, which demystifies the creation process and makes them think "I could do that." It's free advertising for the featured creator.

**Volume:** 1-2 per week

## Platform Strategy (Revised)

### TikTok — 45% of budget ($22,500)

**Why TikTok gets nearly half:** Music content performs best here. The algorithm rewards content quality over follower count, which means a 0-follower Mashups account can go viral if the content is good. And our content IS music — the most native content type on TikTok.

**Organic strategy:**
- Post 2x/day minimum
- Peak times: 11am, 3pm, 7pm, 10pm EST (test and adjust)
- Use trending sounds AS the raw material for flip content (meta: we're remixing what's trending on TikTok using TikTok's own trending sounds)
- Reply to every comment with a video response for the first 30 days

**Paid strategy ($22,500):**
- $15,000 on Spark Ads (boosting top organic performers — only boost posts that already have >5% engagement)
- $5,000 on creator whitelisting (run ads FROM creator accounts, not from brand account)
- $2,500 on TikTok Creator Marketplace for discovery

**Do NOT:**
- Run traditional in-feed ads with a "Download now" CTA. They'll get scrolled past.
- Buy followers. Ever.
- Post content that doesn't contain audio made on Mashups.

### YouTube — 25% of budget ($12,500)

**Why YouTube gets second place:** Longer shelf life than TikTok. A good YouTube Short lives for months. Long-form tutorials create SEO moats that compound over time.

**Shorts strategy:**
- 1 Short/day (repurposed TikTok flips, reformatted)
- Focus on "satisfying transformation" content

**Long-form strategy:**
- 1 video/week: "How [Viral Mashup] Was Made" — deep-dive breakdown of a mashup that's getting plays on the platform
- 1 video/month: "Making a Mashup in X Minutes" — real-time creation with commentary
- The long-form content IS the funnel. Viewers who watch a 10-minute creation video are 8x more likely to sign up than Short viewers.

**Paid strategy ($12,500):**
- $7,500 on Shorts ads (target: music production, FL Studio, Ableton audiences)
- $5,000 on in-stream ads before popular production tutorial videos

### Instagram — 15% of budget ($7,500)

**Why Instagram drops from V1's 25%:** Instagram's algorithm deprioritizes audio-first content. Reels auto-mute on scroll. Music creation content performs worse here than on TikTok or YouTube. Still worth being present, but not the primary channel.

**Strategy:**
- 1 Reel/day (best-performing TikToks, reformatted)
- Carousel posts: visual before/after of mashup waveforms (the visual format plays to Instagram's strengths)
- Stories: Daily polls ("Which genre should we flip this into?"), behind-the-scenes
- IG Lives: Weekly collab session with a creator (Wednesdays 8pm EST)

**Paid strategy ($7,500):**
- $5,000 Reels ads targeting Lookalike audiences from website visitors
- $2,500 retargeting ads for website visitors who didn't sign up

### Twitter/X — 10% of budget ($5,000)

**Strategy:**
- The "producer Twitter" community is real and engaged
- Post audio snippets as native video (Twitter auto-plays with sound off, so add waveform visualization)
- Thread format: "I took 3 random stems and made a track in 5 minutes. Thread:"
- Engage in existing music production conversations (don't just broadcast)
- Spaces: Weekly 1-hour production hangout (not an AMA — a casual conversation)

**Paid strategy ($5,000):**
- $3,000 promoted tweets (only promote tweets with high organic engagement)
- $2,000 follower campaigns targeting music production audiences

### Reddit & Discord — 5% of budget ($2,500)

**Strategy — Reddit:**
- Do NOT advertise directly. Reddit users will destroy you.
- Participate genuinely in r/WeAreTheMusicMakers, r/edmproduction, r/makinghiphop
- Share mashups made on the platform as "here's something I made" — not "check out our platform"
- When people ask "what's the best free DAW?" answer honestly (and mention Mashups where genuinely relevant)
- One AMA per month with a successful Mashups creator

**Strategy — Discord:**
- Create a Mashups Discord server focused on community, not marketing
- Channels: showcase, feedback, challenges, collabs, genre-specific rooms
- The Discord becomes the retention engine — people stay because of relationships, not features
- Budget: $2,500 for Discord Nitro boosts, challenge prizes, and community events

## Creator Partnership Program (Replacing "Influencer Strategy")

### Philosophy Change From V1

V1 treats influencers as ad channels — pay them to post, get impressions. V2 treats creators as partners — invest in their success, they naturally talk about what made them successful.

### The Founding 50

Instead of 175 influencers across 4 tiers, invest deeply in 50 creators:

**Selection criteria:**
- Already making music (any DAW) and posting it on social media
- 1K-50K followers (big enough to matter, small enough to care)
- Active and responsive (reply rate > 50% on their posts)
- Genuinely excited about mashups/remixes (not just willing to post for money)

**What they get:**
- Lifetime Pro access
- Direct line to the product team (private Discord channel)
- Their feature requests get priority
- Early access to every new feature
- Co-credit on any platform content featuring their work
- Revenue share on any paid challenges they participate in

**What they DON'T get:**
- A script to read
- A required posting schedule
- A contractual obligation

**What they DO (naturally):**
- Use the platform because it's genuinely useful to them
- Talk about it because they're genuinely excited
- Give real feedback because they have a direct line to the team
- Create content that feels authentic because it IS authentic

**Budget:** $10,000 (Pro access costs, travel to meetups, small appreciation gifts)

**Expected outcome:** 50 authentic, long-term advocates > 175 one-off sponsored posts

### Collab Drops

Monthly partnership with one established artist (50K-500K followers):

**Format:** The artist provides exclusive stems. The Mashups community has one week to flip them. The artist picks their favorite. The winner gets a feature/shoutout from the artist.

**Why it works:** The artist gets content (dozens of remixes to share). The community gets exclusive material. Mashups gets the artist's audience exposed to the platform. Everyone wins without anyone feeling marketed to.

**Budget:** $5,000/month x 3 months = $15,000 (artist fees + prizes)

---

## Challenge Series (Revised)

### Challenge 1: "Flip This in 5" (Days 1-30, ongoing weekly)

**Concept:** Every Monday at noon EST, a 30-second audio clip drops. Could be anything — a vinyl record scratch, a bird call, a speech excerpt, a random instrument. You have until Friday to flip it into a mashup using the platform. Community votes over the weekend. Winner announced Monday before the next drop.

**Why this beats V1's #FlipThis:** The source material is weird and unexpected, not just "a trending sound." The constraint of unusual material forces genuine creativity and produces more interesting, shareable results.

**Prizes:** $250/week to winner (total: $3,000 over 12 weeks). Winner gets featured in the following week's content.

### Challenge 2: "The Telephone Game" (Days 30-60)

**Concept:** 10 chains of 10 creators each. Creator 1 makes a 15-second mashup. Creator 2 can only hear the last 5 seconds and must extend it. Creator 3 hears the last 5 seconds of Creator 2's extension. Continue for 10 links. The final result is a track that evolved through 10 creative handoffs.

**Why this is unique:** The gradual transformation is inherently fascinating (like a game of telephone). The content IS the challenge — you can't explain this without showing it. It creates 10-person creative teams who bond through the experience.

**Prizes:** Best chain wins $1,000 split among all 10 participants. Runner-up chain: $500 split. Budget: $1,500.

### Challenge 3: "Genre Roulette" (Days 60-90)

**Concept:** Spin a wheel, get two genres. Make a mashup that fuses them. The more absurd the combo, the better. Community votes on most creative fusion.

**Categories rotate weekly:**
- Week 1: Classical x Trap
- Week 2: Bossa Nova x Dubstep
- Week 3: Gregorian Chant x Hyperpop
- Week 4: Bluegrass x Techno

**Prizes:** $500/week winner + "Genre Bender" badge. Total: $2,000.

## Budget Allocation ($50,000)

| Category | Amount | % | Notes |
|----------|--------|---|-------|
| **TikTok (Paid + Production)** | $22,500 | 45% | Primary acquisition channel |
| **YouTube (Paid + Production)** | $12,500 | 25% | SEO moat + long-form funnel |
| **Creator Partnerships** | $10,000 | 20% | Founding 50 program |
| **Collab Drops** (Artist Partnerships) | $5,000 | 10% | 1 artist/month for first month, scale if working |
| **Instagram (Paid)** | $7,500 | 15% | Reels + retargeting |
| **Twitter/X (Paid)** | $5,000 | 10% | Producer community |
| **Reddit/Discord** | $2,500 | 5% | Organic community |
| **Challenge Prizes** | $6,500 | 13% | 3 challenge series |
| **Content Production** | $2,000 | 4% | Editing tools, assets |
| **Contingency/Testing** | $2,000 | 4% | Experiment with emerging channels |
| | | | |
| **Subtotal Paid Media** | $47,500 | | |
| **Subtotal Organic Investment** | $2,500 | | |
| **TOTAL** | **$50,000** | **100%** | |

**Note on V1's budget math:** V1's percentages added to 200%+ because platform percentages (40%+25%+20%+10%+5%=100%) and category percentages (59%+65%+15%+6%+4%+11%=160%) were conflated. V2 uses absolute dollar amounts to avoid confusion.

## Metrics That Matter

### Leading Indicators (Track Daily)
| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Signups from social | 150/day by Day 60 | Direct acquisition signal |
| Time-to-first-mashup | < 15 min for social signups | Activation quality |
| Social shares (platform-generated) | 500/day by Day 60 | Organic distribution |
| Challenge participation rate | 30%+ of active users | Community engagement |

### Lagging Indicators (Track Weekly)
| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| D7 retention (social cohort) | > 35% | Acquired users actually stick |
| Mashups created per user (first week) | > 2 | Activation depth |
| Organic K-factor | > 0.3 (target 0.4) | Self-sustaining growth |
| CAC by channel | < $5 blended | Sustainable economics |
| Creator-to-listener ratio | > 1:5 | Healthy two-sided marketplace |

### What To Kill (Stop if these happen)
- CAC on any channel exceeds $10 sustained — reallocate budget
- Engagement rate on any content type drops below 3% for 2 weeks — stop producing that type
- Any influencer partnership produces < 50 signups — don't renew
- Any challenge gets < 100 entries — redesign or cancel

---

---

## What This Plan Does NOT Include (And Why)

1. **Brand partnerships / sponsored content deals** — At 18K MAU, the brand isn't big enough to attract meaningful brand deals. Focus on growing first.

2. **PR / press outreach** — Press coverage for a pre-launch music platform generates fleeting spikes, not sustained growth. Invest in product-led growth instead.

3. **Podcast advertising** — CPM is too high for our budget, and attribution is nearly impossible. Revisit at $200K+ budget.

4. **Conference presence / events** — Same as PR. Not yet the right scale. The Discord IS the event.

5. **SEO / content marketing blog** — Long-term play that won't move the needle in 90 days. The YouTube long-form strategy IS the SEO play.

---

## Success Criteria

At Day 90, the campaign is a success if:

- [ ] 10,000+ new signups (from 2,000 baseline)
- [ ] 50,000+ MAU (from 18,400 baseline)
- [ ] K-factor > 0.3 (from 0.15 baseline)
- [ ] Blended CAC < $5
- [ ] D7 retention for social-acquired users > 35%
- [ ] At least 3 pieces of content achieved > 100K organic views
- [ ] The Founding 50 program has a 70%+ retention rate (still actively using platform at Day 90)
- [ ] At least 1 Collab Drop artist reposts community content to their own audience

The campaign is a failure if:
- Total signups < 5,000 (less than half the target)
- Blended CAC > $10 (unsustainable)
- D7 retention < 20% (acquiring the wrong users)
- No organic content exceeds 50K views (content strategy isn't resonating)
