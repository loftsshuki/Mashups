Date: February 13, 2026  
Brand: `Mashups.com`

## 1. Brand Core
### Mission
Give creators a rights-safe system to make, distribute, and monetize remix culture.

### Positioning
Mashups is the creator operating system for music-driven short-form growth: creation, licensing, campaigns, analytics, and monetization in one product.

### Audience
1. Primary: short-form creators (TikTok/IG/YouTube Shorts, including OF creators using teaser funnels)
2. Secondary: rightsholders, labels, agencies, sponsor brands
3. Tertiary: enterprise creator networks

### Promise
Create faster, publish safer, grow bigger.

## 2. Brand Personality
1. Bold
2. Electric
3. Precise
4. Commercially credible
5. Creator-first

## 3. Messaging Framework
### One-liner
Build viral, rights-safe music content from one command center.

### Elevator pitch
Mashups helps creators produce remix content, issue platform-safe licenses, run campaigns, and track performance end-to-end without juggling separate tools.

### Tagline options
1. `Mix Fast. Go Viral.`
2. `Where Remix Culture Scales.`
3. `Create. License. Grow.`

## 4. Voice and Tone
1. Clear and direct (no hype fluff)
2. Performance-oriented language
3. Confident but technical when needed
4. “Creator ops” vocabulary over “music app” vocabulary

## 5. Visual Direction (Pink-Neon)
### Color intent
1. Core pink as brand anchor
2. Warm neon secondary for energy
3. Deep neutral background for contrast and premium feel

### Starter token targets (aligned to app theme)
1. Primary pink: high-chroma magenta/pink
2. Secondary: warm coral/rose
3. Accent: cool electric contrast used sparingly
4. UI neutrals: charcoal/plum-leaning darks + bright foreground

### Usage rules
1. Keep large surfaces dark and calm
2. Use pink glow for active actions, highlights, and conversion CTAs
3. Use gradients as framing, not full-background noise

## 6. Typography Direction
### Pairing A (recommended)
1. Headline: `Space Grotesk` (assertive, modern)
2. UI/body: `Inter` or `Geist` (clean and readable)

### Pairing B
1. Headline: `Sora`
2. UI/body: `Manrope`

### Pairing C
1. Headline: `Plus Jakarta Sans`
2. UI/body: `Geist`

## 7. Logo Direction Board
Build all directions first in black/white, then apply pink-neon system.

### Direction 1: `Wave Monogram` (recommended)
Concept:
1. Stylized `M` built from layered waveform peaks
2. Feels music-native + system-like
3. Strong app icon potential

Pros:
1. Ownable
2. Scales well to favicon
3. Clear relation to audio

### Direction 2: `Fusion Mark`
Concept:
1. Two intersecting curves/loops forming a blend node
2. Represents mashup/fork/collab

Pros:
1. Great metaphor for remixing
2. Works well for animation

### Direction 3: `Signal Bolt`
Concept:
1. Angular signal slash with subtle play/wave reference
2. More aggressive creator-tech posture

Pros:
1. Very bold
2. Strong merch/sticker mark

## 8. Logo Construction Specs
1. Grid-built geometry, no tiny notches
2. Minimum size target: 16px favicon still legible

   - Wordmark only
   - Horizontal lockup
   - Stacked lockup
4. Color modes:
   - Black
   - White
   - Flat pink
   - Pink-neon gradient

## 9. Motion Style (for product + socials)
1. Entry animations: quick glow bloom (120-220ms)
2. Logo sting: waveform pulse into static lockup
3. Avoid constant pulsing; reserve motion for transitions and milestones

## 10. Deliverables Checklist

1. Primary logo files (`SVG`, `PDF`, transparent `PNG`)
2. Icon/avatar variants
3. Favicon and app icon set
4. Color tokens and usage rules

3. Select top 3 directions
4. Favicon stress test at 16/24/32px
5. Refine winner in Illustrator
6. Apply pink-neon color system
7. Export and publish brand kit

## 12. Success Criteria
