# Repeat Infringer Policy (Starter)
Effective date: February 13, 2026

Mashups enforces a repeat infringer policy and may suspend or terminate users who repeatedly violate copyright policy.

## 1. Policy Purpose
This policy is designed to:
1. Reduce recurring copyright violations.
2. Support legal compliance and safe-harbor requirements.
3. Provide clear, consistent enforcement standards.

## 2. Strike Events
A strike may be recorded when:
1. A valid copyright notice results in removal or disabling of content.
2. A user repeatedly uploads materially similar infringing content after prior enforcement.

Mashups may also record severity-weighted events for egregious behavior.

## 3. Example Enforcement Ladder
1. Strike 1: Content removal + warning.
2. Strike 2: Temporary feature restrictions (for example, publishing disabled).
3. Strike 3: Account suspension or termination.

Mashups may skip steps in severe cases (for example, obvious large-scale infringement or repeated evasion).

## 4. Expiration and Reset
Mashups may expire strikes after a fixed compliance period (for example, 12 months) at its discretion, except where legal obligations require retention.

## 5. Appeals
Users may dispute enforcement by:
1. Submitting a valid counter-notice where applicable.
2. Providing documentary proof of authorization or ownership.

Mashups reviews appeals and may restore content or reverse strike events if warranted.

## 6. Evasion
Creating new accounts to evade enforcement may result in immediate suspension or termination of related accounts.

## 7. Recordkeeping
Mashups maintains internal logs of notices, removals, counter-notices, and enforcement actions for compliance and audit purposes.
